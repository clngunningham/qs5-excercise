\section*{Solar-Powered Battery Charger}
\end{center}

\section*{Problem Statement}
Many schools in Africa lack a consistent supply of electrical power. This makes it unfeasible to use electrical powered devices such as laptops, phones, calculators, etc. 

\section*{Solution}
Solar powered battery chargers provide a reusable source of energy for those without reliable access to electricity. Distribution of solar powered battery chargers will make it easier for children to use devices powered by batteries.

\section*{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this product should be rewarded because it will enhance the STEM education for children in Africa.  The product provides a cheap, yet effective way to charge batteries for a variety of necessary educational equipment.  This will enable the use of a wide variety of devices in rural areas that lack reliable electricity.  Since the solar energy is used to store energy in the batteries, there is no need for a complicated storage system for the solar energy, reducing cost.  Funding this project will advance the STEM education for children in Africa.
